## Website
The website is really easy to use. When opened, you find a selector, where you can choose if you want to add seconds, minutes or hours. Put the number in the textbox and then click to add. You'll see the result below. You can choose if you want to view the result in seconds, minutes or hours.

If you prefer, you can also have a separated textbox for hours, minutes and seconds. Enable the checkbox and they'll appear.
